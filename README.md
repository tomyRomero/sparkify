###  üìä Database Relationships
- User and Post Relationship:
One-to-Many relationship: A user can create multiple posts, but each post is associated with one user.

- Post and User (author) Relationship:
Many-to-One relationship: Many posts can be associated with one user (the author).

- Post and Post (parent-child) Relationship:
Recursive relationship: A post can have multiple child posts, creating a hierarchical structure.

- Chat and User (sender and receiver) Relationship:
Many-to-Many relationship: A user can be both the sender and receiver in multiple chats.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
### Performance Optimization

- Optimizing performance is my top priority. I aim to minimize unnecessary re-renders on the client and reduce function executions, both on the server and client sides. Contributions in this area will greatly enhance the overall user experience.

- Currently, large API requests to OpenAI, such as those for movies and novels, may lead to server function timeouts. This limitation is due to Vercel's free-tier hosting plan, which imposes a 10-second limit on server functions. Collaborative efforts to address this issue are essential for ensuring smooth interactions with external APIs.

## Project Status

- **Literature Studio**: Works on the deployed version.
- **Story and Gallery Studio**: Currently functional only on localhost.

### Future Feature Idea for Contributions

This project is open source and contributors are welcomed
Future updates may be focused on these new features that I have in mind:

### 1. Post Search

Enhance user experience by implementing a post search functionality, allowing users to discover content more efficiently.

### 2. Followers List and Feed

Introduce a followers list and feed, providing users with a personalized stream of content from accounts they follow.

### 3. Group Chats

Explore the implementation of group chats, fostering community interactions and group discussions.
